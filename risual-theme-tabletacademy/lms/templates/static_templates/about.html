        <p>risual was founded in 2005 on the values of honesty, openness and trust. Set up by two young entrepreneurs, Alun Rogers and Richard Proud, the business still champions these values today. All employees are encouraged to conduct themselves in accordance with our values and treat co-workers, customers and those in the community with the respect they deserve. We never have and never will take on work that is not beneficial to the customer. We have challenged and will continue to challenge ourselves, our customers and our business leaders to do more with technology to improve the world we live in.</p>
